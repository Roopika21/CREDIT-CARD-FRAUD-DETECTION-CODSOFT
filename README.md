# CREDIT-CARD-FRAUD-DETECTION-CODSOFT

Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

This project, developed during my CodSoft internship, aims to identify fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning.

Project Overview

Using an anonymized dataset of transaction records, we applied data preprocessing and several machine learning models to detect fraud accurately.

Workflow

1. Data Preprocessing: Addressed data imbalance with SMOTE and scaled features.


2. EDA: Explored transaction patterns and the distribution of fraudulent vs. legitimate transactions.


3. Modeling: Trained models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost) and evaluated them using metrics like precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.


4. Insights: Identified key features that indicate potential fraud.



Results

The selected model achieved high accuracy in detecting fraud, showcasing the importance of machine learning in enhancing financialÂ security.
